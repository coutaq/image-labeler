# img2pdf
Image to PDF bot is a telegram bot written using the telegram library. It combines photos into a pdf in a convenient way. My first attempt at making a telegram bot btw.

## why even bother with making such a bot
I created this bot because I was pent up with manually combing photos of my homework in MS Word and decided to automate it (y'know cause of laziness)
and it turned out to be quite a challanging yet rewarding project.
